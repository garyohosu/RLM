# RLM (Recursive Loop) kit for Python + Claude Code

This kit provides Markdown prompt files and a minimal runbook to operate a "generic RLM" development loop in Claude Code.

## What you do
1) Copy the contents of this zip into the root of your empty repo.
2) In Claude Code, open the repo and follow `rlm/RUNBOOK.md`.
3) Keep all code changes inside `workspace/` (recommended) or adapt paths if your repo already has its own layout.

## Recommended tooling (optional but ideal)
- pytest
- ruff
- mypy (optional)

You can start without them; the Verifier section in the runbook explains how to configure.
